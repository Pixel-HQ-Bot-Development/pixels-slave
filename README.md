# Hello from the dev team! üëãüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This is a bot dedicated to fun, moderation and utility


### Can I invite the bot?

At the moment, no, this is a private bot for the discord server only, but we are in the process of making a public bot, Bulica

### What is happening with this bot? (all that Bulica Stuff)
This bot will still be worked on and refined even with the public bot "Bulica" in progress, until completion

### Self hosting

Self hosting is **not** recommended as you will not receive support if you manage to break the bot, you can use our code in accordance to the [license](https://github.com/Pixel-HQ-Bot-Development/pixels-slave/blob/main/LICENSE)

### Made by [DJ Pixel#0140 and Church Dude#1088](https://discord.com/invite/A2f7UGK/)
